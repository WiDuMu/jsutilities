# jsutilities
A set of es6 modules I created for personal projects.

## Current utilities
* `download.js`: The function downloads a JavaScript `File` object in a webpage.
* `fileSanitizer.js`: The function sanitizes a filename so it can be accepted by most filesystems.
* `parallelDownload.js`: A group of functions that act like `fetch()` but download a list of files all at once.
* `parser.js`: A wrapper around `DOMParser()` that can turn text into a `Document` object.
* `randomString.js`: Returns a random string generated from a given length and character set.
* `scramble.js`: Uses randomString to create a 'hackery' in a text element.
* `timing.js`: A basic function benchmarking utility.
* `truncation.js`: Some functions that truncate strings with various methods.
